# Java OOP School Project

Welcome to the repository for my Java school project, where I have applied and practiced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project showcases my understanding of key OOP concepts and includes a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests to ensure the robustness of the implemented code.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in the following OOP principles:

1. **Encapsulation:** Classes and methods are structured to encapsulate data and functionality, promoting information hiding and modularity.

2. **Inheritance:** Hierarchical relationships between classes are established to promote code reuse and create a clear and organized class hierarchy.

3. **Polymorphism:** Interfaces and abstract classes are leveraged to enable polymorphic behavior, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in the code.

4. **Abstraction:** Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define common contracts and abstract away implementation details.

## Features

- **Class Hierarchies:** Explore well-defined class hierarchies that showcase the effective use of inheritance and polymorphism.

- **Encapsulation:** Witness encapsulation in action through carefully crafted classes and methods that manage the internal state of objects.

- **Abstraction:** Experience abstraction through interfaces and abstract classes that define common behaviors and characteristics.

- **JUnit Tests:** A comprehensive suite of JUnit tests ensures the correctness and reliability of the implemented code.

## Technologies Used

- **Java:** The project is implemented using the Java programming language.

- **JUnit:** JUnit is employed for unit testing to verify the functionality of the code.
